# Employee Attrition Analysis
## Advanced SQL Analytics for Strategic HR Decision-Making

**Project Overview:** Comprehensive analysis of 3,000+ employee records using BigQuery SQL to identify attrition patterns, predict high-risk employees, and deliver actionable business recommendations.

---

## 🎯 Business Impact

- **Analyzed 3,000+ employee records** across 10 business units and 6 departments
- **Identified critical 19% attrition crisis** in Production departments (NEL, BPC, TNS)
- **Built predictive risk model** flagging 25 current employees for immediate retention action  
- **Discovered IT performance issues** with systematic involuntary termination patterns
- **Delivered 4-priority executive action plan** with specific departmental targets

**Estimated Business Value:** $500K+ in potential turnover cost savings through targeted retention strategies

---

## 📊 Key Findings

### Overall Company Metrics
- **Total Employees:** 3,000
- **Overall Attrition Rate:** 12.9%
- **Termination Breakdown:** 83% Voluntary, 17% Involuntary
- **Departments Analyzed:** Production, IT/IS, Sales across 10 business units

### Critical Discoveries
1. **Production Crisis:** 14-19% attrition across all Production departments
2. **IT Performance Issues:** Most IT terminations are involuntary (fired vs quit)
3. **Sales Success Model:** Excellent retention (0-3% attrition) - best practices to replicate
4. **High-Risk Prediction:** 25 current employees identified for proactive intervention
